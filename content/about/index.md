Hello! Interestingly, I got introduced to programming in my freshman year at [Osmania University](https://www.osmania.ac.in/) where I completed my Bachelors in Information Technology (2016-2020) with a Gold Medal for being a [University Rank Holder](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D9QfLuAibgvQHR8tL8EhwwLrnCxdH5aZ/view?usp=sharing)

I'm currently working as a developer for **One360 LLC**. My responsibility as a Fall intern include MERN, Javascript, Java/Spring, C# based microservices designing, development & testing. 

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!

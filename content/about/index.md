Hello! Interestingly, I got introduced to programming in my freshman year at [Osmania University](https://www.osmaniauniversity.com/) where I completed my Bachelors in Information Technology (2016-2020) with a Gold Medal for being a University Rank Holder ().

I'm currently working as a developer for **One360 LLC**. My responsibilty as a Fall intern include MERN, Javascript, Java/Spring, C# based microservices designing, development & testing. 

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
